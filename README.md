# PROBABILISTIC PARSER: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EARLEY PARSER ALGORITHM WITH THE USE OF PROBABILITIES

The Earley Parser algorithm implemented in C ++ following the pseudocode of this [document](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~luger/ai-final2/CH9_Dynamic%20Programming%20and%20the%20Earley%20Parser.pdf).

In addition, each Production of the grammar will be assigned a probability to achieve optimizations.
